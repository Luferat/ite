            <br/>Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) DSL<b></b>is an always-on technology, meanng that there is no need to dial up each time to connect to the Internet. DSL uses the existing copper telephone lines to provide high-speed digital data communication between end users and telephone companies. Unlike ISDN, where the digital data communications replaces the analog voice communications, DSL shares the telephone wire with analog signals. </p>
          <p>With DSL, the voice and data signals are carried on different frequencies on the copper telephone wires. A filter prevents DSL signals from interfering with phone signals. You plug the filter into a phone jack, and plug the phone into the filter. </p>
          <p>The DSL modem does not require a filter. The DSL modem is not affected by the frequencies of the telephone. Like a cable modem, a DSL modem can connect directly to your computer, or it can be connected to a networking device to share the Internet connection with multiple computers.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)</b>
            <br/>There are many different types of DSL. Typically a home user uses ADSL. ADSL has different bandwidth capabilities in each direction. ADSL has a fast downstream speed, ranging from 384 Kbps to 6 Mbps. Downstream is the process of transferring data from the server to the end user. This is beneficial to users who are downloading large amounts of data. The high-speed upload rate of ADSL is slower. ADSL does not perform well when hosting a web server or FTP server, both of which involve upload-intensive Internet activities. </p>
