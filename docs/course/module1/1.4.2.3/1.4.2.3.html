          <p>Twisted-pair is a type of copper cabling used for telephone communications and most Ethernet networks. A pair of wires forms a circuit that can transmit data. The pair is twisted to provide protection against crosstalk, which is the noise generated by adjacent pairs of wires in the cable. Pairs of copper wires are encased in color-coded plastic insulation and twisted together. An outer jacket protects the bundles of twisted pairs. A twisted-pair cable is shown in Figure 1. </p>
          <p>When electricity flows through a copper wire, a magnetic field is created around the wire. A circuit has two wires. The two wires in that circuit have oppositely charged magnetic fields. When the two wires of the circuit are next to each other, the magnetic fields cancel each other out. This is called the cancellation effect. Without the cancellation effect, network communications become slow due to the interference caused by the magnetic fields.</p>
          <p>There are two basic types of twisted-pair cables: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP)</b> – Cable that has two or four pairs of wires. This type of cable relies solely on the cancellation effect produced by the twisted-wire pairs that limits signal degradation caused by electromagnetic interface (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). UTP is the most commonly used cabling in networks. UTP cables have a length up to 100 m (328 ft). </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Shielded twisted-pair (STP)</b> – Each pair of wires is wrapped in metallic foil to better shield the wires from noise. Four pairs of wires are then wrapped in an overall metallic braid or foil. STP reduces electrical noise from within the cable. It also reduces EMI and RFI from outside the cable. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Although STP prevents interference better than UTP, STP is more expensive because of extra shielding, and more difficult to install because of the thickness. In addition, the metallic shielding must be grounded at both ends. If improperly grounded, the shield acts like an antenna picking up unwanted signals. STP is primarily used outside of North America. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Category Rating </b>
            <br/>Twisted-pair cables come in several categories (Cat) that are based on two factors:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Number of wires in the cable </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Number of twists in those wires </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The size of the network determines the type of network cable that will be used. Most networks today are wired using twisted-pair copper cable. The characteristics of twisted-pair cable are shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p>New or renovated office buildings often have some type of UTP cabling that connects every office to a central point called the Main Distribution Facility (MDF). The distance limitation of UTP cabling used for data is 330 feet (100 m). Cable runs in excess of this distance limitation need a repeater or hub to extend the connection to the MDF.</p>
          <p>Cables that are installed inside the walls and ceilings of buildings must be plenum rated. A plenum cable is one that is safe for installation between a dropped ceiling and the structural ceiling of a building where air circulation takes place. Plenum-rated cables are made from a special plastic that retards fire and produces less smoke than other cable types.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Cat 3 cables use a 6-pin RJ-11 connector, whereas all other twisted-pair cables use an 8-pin RJ-45 connector, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
