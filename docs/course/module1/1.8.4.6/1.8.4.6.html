          <p>After the network has been set up and tested, you can map the network drives. Mapping a local drive letter (A to Z) is a useful way to share a single file, specific folders, or an entire drive between different operating systems over a network. Mapping a drive allows you to use shared resources as if they were a local hard drive. For example, if Windows 7 and Windows Vista or Windows XP are being used in the same workgroup, a homegroup cannot be set up. However, drives can be mapped to shared resources in the same workgroup.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Network File Sharing</b>
            <br/>First determine which resources will be shared over the network and the type of permissions users will have to the resources. Permissions define the type of access a user has to a file or folder.</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Read</b> – The user can view the file and subfolder names, navigate to subfolders, view data in files, and run program files.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Change</b> – In addition to Read permissions, the user can add files and subfolders, change the data in files, and delete subfolders and files.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Full Control</b> – In addition to Change and Read permissions, the user can change the permission of files and folders in an NTFS partition and take ownership of files and folders.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Copy or move the resources to a share folder.</p>
          <p>To share resources in Windows 7 and Windows Vista, use the following path:</p>
          <p>Right-click the folder <b>></b><b>Properties ></b><b>Advanced Sharing > </b>select <b>Share this folder > Permissions</b>. Identify who has access to the folder and which permissions. Figure 1 shows the permissions window of a shared folder.</p>
          <p>To share resources in Windows XP, use the following path:</p>
          <p>Right-click the folder <b>></b> select <b>Sharing and Security > Share this folder</b>. Identify who has access to the folder and which permissions.</p>
          <p>
            <br/>Network Drive MappingTo map a network drive to a shared folder, use the following path:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Start ></b> right-click <b>Computer > Map network drive</b>. Locate the shared folder over the network and assign a drive letter, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p>Windows 7 is limited to a maximum of 20 simultaneous file-sharing connections. Windows Vista Business and Windows XP Professional are limited to a maximum of 10 simultaneous file-sharing connections. </p>
